# GDP Analysis

This project involves the analysis of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data up to the year 2016. The dataset used for this analysis is available in the `gdp.csv` file, which is included in this repository.

**Note:** The `gdp.csv` file contains GDP data up to the year 2016.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Year`: The year for which GDP data is recorded.
- `Country`: The name of the country.
- `Country Code`: The code representing the country.
- `Value`: The GDP value in trillions of US dollars for that year and country.

## Analysis and Visualizations

In this project, we perform the following tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning**: We clean the dataset by handling missing values (if any) and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We perform EDA to gain insights into the GDP data. Some of the key visualizations include:
   - Trends in GDP over the years.
   - Comparison of GDP between countries.
   - Year-wise growth rates of GDP.

3. **Data Visualization**: We create various visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate the findings from the EDA.

## HTML Reports

You can view the following HTML reports for additional insights:

2. [World Value Comparison](World.html) :
   This report offers a comparison of GDP values among different countries.


## How to Use

**1. Clone the Repository:**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tanyadiwan/Python-Tkinter/tree/main/GDP%20Analysis

**1. Install Dependencies:**

Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already. You can use pip to install them:

1. `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.

```bash
pip install pandas
```
2. `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
3. `seaborn`: For enhanced data visualization.
```bash
pip install seaborn
```
4. `plotly`: For interactive data visualization, including `plotly.offline` and `plotly.express`.
```bash
pip install plotly
```
5. `os`: For interaction with the operating system (already included in Python).

**2. Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

Open the Jupyter Notebook `GDP Analysis.ipynb` to view the analysis and visualizations. You can do this by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook GDP Analysis.ipynb
```
